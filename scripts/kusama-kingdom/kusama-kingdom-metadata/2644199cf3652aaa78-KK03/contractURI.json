  "description": "Legend has it that there once existed ten legendary swords, each possessing powers that only a Legendary Kusama King could wield. Great battles of old were fought with the swords and lands were conquered in both the living world and the dead. Now, lost to the ages, these swords have not been seen in many centuries, Still to this day each sword calls out to its Legendary King, and he is draw to its aura. It is now down to you to recover these swords by assembling an army that brings Kings from across the land together to assist each Legendary King in his quest.",
